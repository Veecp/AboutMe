  <h1>Places I Want To Visit</h1>

  <p>As a young child, I have always been interested in travelling the World and curious to see what else is out there.
	Now as an adult, I'm currently trying to work my butt off to be able to do these things (because these things do
	cost a <strong>LOT</strong> of moola). It's crazy to think that as of now, I've probably only experienced maybe 1%
	of what there is to see State/Country-wise. So here I'm going to list the Top 3 on my travel wish-list that I hope
	to explore one day!</p>
  <p><em>Enjoy!</em>â˜º</p>

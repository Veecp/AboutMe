		<h1>About Vee <3</h1>

			<p>Hi! My name is Victoria Pacheco. I was born on October 21st, 1996 in Clovis, New Mexico and raised in Tucumcari, New Mexico. I am the youngest of 2 siblings. I am now 26 years old and I currently reside in Amarillo, Texas. I'm an aspiring Web Developer and working hard towards a fulfilling career doing what I love. My love for technology began back in the MySpace era, I taught myself how to code the layouts, widgets, and music players at a VERY young age and now that I'm an adult, I plan to learn all what there is to know about Web Development so I can pursue it as a career.</p>

		<p>Below I'm going to list a few random facts about me, along with what I enjoy to do in my free time :D</p>

<ul>
	<li>I want to move to Oregon within the next couple of years because I love the scenery <strong>THAT</strong> much.</li>
	<li>I have another niece/nephew on the way that's due on my late Grandpa's birthday :')</li>
	<li>My favorite color is purple</li>
	<li>My dog Madi is a registered ESA (Emotional Service Animal)</li>
	<li>I watch Podcasts more than anything</li>
	<li>I love to play video games</li>
	<li>I've NEVER been out of country</li>
</ul>
